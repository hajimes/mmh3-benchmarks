# mmh3-benchmarks

Repository to store the benchmarking results of
[mmh3](https://github.com/hajimes/mmh3).

Directories follow the naming convention `date-<commit>`, where `<commit>` is
the shortened commit hash from the `master` branch of the `mmh3` repository. This
commit is the one most closely associated with the benchmarking results,
though the benchmarks may not have been run on that specific commit.
